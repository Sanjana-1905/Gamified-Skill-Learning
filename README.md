# üéÆ Gamified Skill Learning for DAA

This project introduces a gamified learning system powered by **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)**. Instead of traditional static lessons, users experience interactive learning through algorithmically selected questions, spaced reviews, adaptive rewards, and knowledge tracing. Every aspect is driven by real DAA logic.

## üöÄ Features

- üìä Adaptive question selection using Q-Learning and Knapsack
- üîÅ Personalized review scheduling with SM2 and MinHeap
- üéÅ Dynamic reward system based on Variable Ratio Reinforcement and Fenwick Tree
- üß† Knowledge tracing using Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and Dynamic Programming
- üîç **Real-time Algorithm Insights** - See how each algorithm works after every question
- üìà **Algorithm Performance Dashboard** - Track algorithm effectiveness over time
- ‚ú® Intuitive UI using React + TailwindCSS, built with Vite
